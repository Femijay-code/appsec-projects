# Application Security Projects

This repository is a growing collection of hands-on **application security projects**.  
Each project demonstrates common security vulnerabilities and their secure implementations, helping to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

## üìÇ Current Projects

### 1. SQL Injection Demo
- **Folder:** `sql-injection-demo/`
- A deliberately vulnerable web application showcasing **SQL Injection (SQLi)** attacks.
- Goal: Learn how SQLi works, identify vulnerabilities, and practice exploiting them in a safe environment.

### 2. SQL Injection Safe Version
- **Folder:** `sql-injection-safe/`
- A secure version of the SQLi demo app.
- Demonstrates how to properly implement **input validation, prepared statements, and secure coding practices** to prevent SQL Injection.

## üìå Roadmap (Upcoming Projects)

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Command Injection  
- Insecure File Uploads  
- Authentication & Session Management flaws  
- More OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Navigate into a project folder (e.g., `sql-injection-demo/` or `sql-injection-safe/`).
2. Follow the setup instructions in that project‚Äôs README.
3. Experiment with the vulnerable app, then compare it with the secure version.

---

## üéØ Purpose
- Document and showcase hands-on **application security projects**.
- Provide a structured learning path for understanding and preventing real-world vulnerabilities.
- Serve as a professional portfolio for practical security skills.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These projects are for **educational purposes only**.  
Do not deploy vulnerable versions in production environments.
